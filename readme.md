# Think Shift SRC

This is a rapid prototype / wireframe framework for HTML/CSS build in SASS. The goal of this framework is to allow us to wireframe and prototype a website quickly and easily using pre-built and pre-tested modules that are based on common design patterns, and it can be work that we can build a website up from.

## Documentation

Is sparse at the moment. Your best bet is to look at the examples in the /docs and view the source to see how the framework can be used.

Documentation on the custom mixins are coming soon.

Roadmap is coming soon.

This is pre-release, gimme a break.
